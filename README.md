# nmsu-survival
Documents, templates, and other useful things to help you survive grad school at NMSU.

Letterhead: written by me, mimicing the style seen in various official NMSU letter/memo PDFs
Another letterhead option, if you have access to the NMSU astronomy server: `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/nmsuletter.sty` which uses the file `/usr/local/logo/logo.eps`

I originally included an AASTeX-nmsu thesis template bundle by Jeff Coughlin in this repo, but I took it down because a friend rightly pointed out it isn't mine to share. Feel free to get in touch if you're interested to know more.
