Documents, templates, and other useful things to help you survive grad school at NMSU.

Letterhead: written by me, mimicing the style seen in various official NMSU letter/memo PDFs

Another letterhead option, if you have access to the NMSU astronomy server: `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/nmsuletter.sty` which uses the file `/usr/local/logo/logo.eps`

I also **highly recommend** this repo for formatting your thesis: https://github.com/JeffLCoughlin/aastex-thesis
